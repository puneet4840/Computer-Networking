**How is the Computer Network and Internet started?**

In 1960-70, During the cold war era in the United States. The US Department of Defence (DoD) wanted scientists to share the information easily and efficiently. Then, US Department of Defence created a research agency ARPA (Adevanced Research Projects Agency). ARPA created a project called ARPANET.
  **The aim of this agency was to build a communication network that could work even if any part of network destroyed. (Important during the war).**

Before ARPA, computer networks were like a single phone lines, If one line broke then whole conversation stopped.
ARPANET introduced a revolutionary concept called **Packet Switching**. Suppose you are sending a letter, packet switching breaks down the letter into smaller pieces like sentences. These smaller packets of information can travel independently over different routes. If one route gets blocked or delayed, no prolem!. The packets can take another route to reach their destination. This was the new way of communication between computers.
The first ARPANET connection was made between UCLA and Standford institute in 1969. Then technology eveolved and spread across other regions.
